{\bfseries By using the native A\-P\-I, you assert that you know what you're doing and how to fix problems caused by using it. If you don't, you shouldn't be using it.}

Before the inclusion of \hyperlink{glfw3native_8h}{glfw3native.\-h}, you must define exactly one window A\-P\-I macro and exactly one context A\-P\-I macro. Failure to do this will cause a compile-\/time error.

The available window A\-P\-I macros are\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily G\-L\-F\-W\-\_\-\-E\-X\-P\-O\-S\-E\-\_\-\-N\-A\-T\-I\-V\-E\-\_\-\-W\-I\-N32}
\item {\ttfamily G\-L\-F\-W\-\_\-\-E\-X\-P\-O\-S\-E\-\_\-\-N\-A\-T\-I\-V\-E\-\_\-\-C\-O\-C\-O\-A}
\item {\ttfamily G\-L\-F\-W\-\_\-\-E\-X\-P\-O\-S\-E\-\_\-\-N\-A\-T\-I\-V\-E\-\_\-\-X11}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The available context A\-P\-I macros are\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily G\-L\-F\-W\-\_\-\-E\-X\-P\-O\-S\-E\-\_\-\-N\-A\-T\-I\-V\-E\-\_\-\-W\-G\-L}
\item {\ttfamily G\-L\-F\-W\-\_\-\-E\-X\-P\-O\-S\-E\-\_\-\-N\-A\-T\-I\-V\-E\-\_\-\-N\-S\-G\-L}
\item {\ttfamily G\-L\-F\-W\-\_\-\-E\-X\-P\-O\-S\-E\-\_\-\-N\-A\-T\-I\-V\-E\-\_\-\-G\-L\-X}
\item {\ttfamily G\-L\-F\-W\-\_\-\-E\-X\-P\-O\-S\-E\-\_\-\-N\-A\-T\-I\-V\-E\-\_\-\-E\-G\-L}
\end{DoxyItemize}

These macros select which of the native access functions that are declared and which platform-\/specific headers to include. It is then up your (by definition platform-\/specific) code to handle which of these should be defined.
